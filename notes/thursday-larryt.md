These are my thursday notes.

Repository holds the info --> remote is an alias for the outside holder of that info --> branch is a bookmark that shows where I am working.

single = sets value
double == compares two values to see if equal. 2 == '2' is true
triple === always us to compare. must be exact. 2 === '2' is false

truthy - there's something there (1, 'string', yes, true)
falsy - nothing there (0, undefined, null, false)

DRY- Don't Repeat Yourself

"Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast."
